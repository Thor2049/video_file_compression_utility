# Final Modifications Summary

## Changes Implemented (Latest Round)

### 1. ✅ Added Comprehensive .txt Log File
**What was added:**
- Created `logs/` directory for storing log files
- Timestamped log files: `compression_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`
- Dual logging: Both console output AND file logging
- Logs everything: file processing, skipping, errors, completion, state changes

**Benefits:**
- Review processing history even after script stops
- Troubleshoot issues by examining log files
- Track multiple batch conversions over time
- Each session gets its own timestamped log file

**Location:** `/logs/compression_20251005_143022.txt` (example)

**What gets logged:**
- Script startup and configuration
- Files found and queued
- Files skipped (with reason)
- Processing start/completion for each file
- Errors encountered
- Shutdown and state clearing

---

### 2. ✅ Clear State Files on Shutdown
**What was added:**
- New `StateManager.clear_all_state()` method
- Automatically called when Ctrl+C is pressed
- Clears all JSON state files: queue.json, current.json, completed.json, errors.json

**Benefits:**
- Fresh start every time you run the script
- No stale data from previous runs
- Web interface shows only current session data
- Cleaner workflow for each batch conversion

**Behavior:**
```
User presses Ctrl+C →
  Script stops monitoring →
    Completes current file (if any) →
      Clears all state files →
        Logs shutdown →
          Exits gracefully
```

**Note:** Log files are **preserved** for historical review

---

### 3. ✅ Skipped Files Shown in Web Interface
**What was added:**
- Files with wrong suffix now added to `errors.json`
- These files appear in the "Errors/Skipped" section of web interface
- Clear reason shown: "Missing required suffix pattern (space + xx/XX)"

**Before:** Files skipped silently (only console warning)
**After:** Files shown in web UI with explanation

**Example:**
```
⚠️ Errors & Skipped Files
2 error(s) or skipped file(s)

1. my_video.mp4
   Reason: Missing required suffix pattern (space + xx/XX)
   Path: /videos/batch1/my_video.mp4
   Time: 2025-10-05 14:30:22
```

**Benefits:**
- Visibility into what was NOT processed
- Easy to identify files that need renaming
- Helps catch naming mistakes
- All in one place: both processed and skipped files

## Usage Example (Complete Workflow)

### Session 1: Initial Batch

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start compression
$ python handbrakevidz.py --watch ~/Videos/ToCompress

2025-10-05 14:30:15 - Log file created: logs/compression_20251005_143015.txt
2025-10-05 14:30:15 - HandbrakeCLI version: 1.7.3
2025-10-05 14:30:15 - ffprobe is available: ffprobe
2025-10-05 14:30:15 - Starting to monitor: /home/user/Videos/ToCompress
2025-10-05 14:30:15 - Monitoring started. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
2025-10-05 14:30:20 - Processing folder: batch1
2025-10-05 14:30:20 - Skipping 'wrong_name.mp4' - missing required suffix pattern

- **Completed**: 3 files processed
- **Errors/Skipped**: 1 file (wrong_name.mp4 - Missing required suffix)

### User presses Ctrl+C:

```
2025-10-05 14:42:30 - Monitoring stopped by user.
